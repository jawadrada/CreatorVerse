## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

Some challenges I encountered were realizing that I was less comfortable with React Router than I initially thought. I ended up learning about two new hooks, useNavigate and useParams, which I had not used before. Additionally, I challenged myself to get the styling to match as closely as possible to the original website, which was difficult. Figuring out how to embed all the child routes within the homepage also took some time to understand and implement.
